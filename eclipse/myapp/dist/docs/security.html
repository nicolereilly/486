  <h2>WebApp Security Notes</h2>

  <h3>Authentication</h3>
  <p>
  The servlet 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 specs allow for the following kinds of authentication:
  <ul>
  <li><b>BASIC</b></li> 
  Uses the browser's built-in login mechanism; sends username and base64 
  encrypted password with every request<br>
  NOTE: Using ethereal to look at network traffic shows that IE 6 and 7 do NOT
  use base64 encoding.  The password is completely in the clear.
  <li><b>DIGEST</b></li> 
  encrypted password; not fully supported by browsers nor containers<br>
  As far as I can tell, weblogic has never supported DIGEST, neither has
  SunONE.  Tomcat 4.1 supports it to some extent, but not fully.  Old
  browsers that use HTTP 1.0 cannot support this.<br>
  TODO: test latest Tomcat
  <li><b>HTTPS Client Authentication</b></li> 
  browser-based certificate<br>
  not practical for internet use and a pain for intranets
  <li><b>Form</b></li> 
  Java EE web container intercepts form-based request and uses
  web.xml along with container-specific info to perform authentication<br>
  <em>Usually the best choice for simple security requirements.</em>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  A more flexible choice is JAAS.  JAAS is still fairly new so the support
  is spotty and not very consistent, but should get better soon.
  Two free JAAS implementations:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Tagish</b></li>
  Supports a file-based/MD5-hashed password configuration, JDBC configuration,
  and a WINNT/2000 configuration.
  <li><b>JAASLounge</b></li>
  Supports an NT Lan Manager config, Active Directory config, and a Mapper config that can combine one or more delegate modules.
  </ul>
  This webapp uses the JAASLounge NTLM configuration which appears to work
  fine with Win 2000 Active Directory.  The JAASLounge AD config requires
  a lot more configuration (e.g., Kerberos).<br>

  </p>


  <h3>Authorization</h3>
  <p>
  Authorization can be permission-based or role-based.  Desktop apps are
  usually permission-based while webapps are usually role-based.  The Java EE
  specs address role-based permissions and have built-in support.  If a
  client requires permission-based authorization (e.g., a user can create
  a file and be the owner of that file), be aware that this is outside of
  the Java EE specs and will be quite a challenge.  If you must implement this
  kind of security, there is an article regarding struts/jaas integration
  at www.mooreds.com that was published on the serverside.com.  IBM may
  have more up-to-date info.
  </p>
  <p>
  <em>Therefore, always try to use role-based authorization.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
  Using roles directly in code is not very flexible.  It is best to create 
  role references, at the servlet level, which can be mapped to different 
  user roles, allowing redeployment without recompilation.
